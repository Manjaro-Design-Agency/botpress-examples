# Tutorial

This tutorial will show you how easy it is to build a motivation bot using Botpress and Messenger. For this purpose, we will build a bot from scratch and we will end up with a little motivation bot in about 30 minutes. If you have any problems, do not hesitate to talk to us on our [Public Chatroom](https://gitter.im/botpress/core), it will be a pleasure for us to answer your requests.

If you don't want to follow up our step-by-step guide to build this bot, you can clone this repository and just try it by linking it to a Facebook Page and Messenger App. (Step #5-6)

## Requirements

Botpress requires [node](https://nodejs.org) (version >= 4.2) and uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) as package manager.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Install botpress

First thing you need to have `botpress` installed as a general dependency using `npm`. If it's done yet, you only need to install it using command line and

```
npm install -g botpress
```

### 2. Create a new repository

Once `botpress` has been installed, in your command line tool, you need to create a new repository and move into it.

```
mkdir motivation-bot && cd motivation-bot // Mac and Linux users

md motivation-bot && cd motivation-bot // Windows users
```

### 3. Initialization

```
botpress init
```
